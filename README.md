Rules
The first page of the game will be a welcome page, It will continue two buttons start game and another is a rule
The rules are:
You are the gardian of the book which contains the information about the invantions which changed the world. 
There are an evil wizard who stole 3 pages from the book which contains the important inventions .
In order to return those pages you need to play the game. Wizzard will choose the number from 1-9 and you need to guess the number. You will have 5 tries, if you guess the number the wizzard will return you a page with one of the inventions. You then have a choice quite or continue playing. 
If you did not guess the number you loose, and the wizzard will change the history.
