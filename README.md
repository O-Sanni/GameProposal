There are an evil wizard who stole 3 pages from the book which contains the important inventions .
In order to return those pages you need to play the game. Wizzard will choose the number from 1-9 and you need to guess the number. You will have 5 tries, if you guess the number the wizzard will return you a page with one of the inventions. You then have a choice quite or continue playing.

Pseudocode:
My JavaScript will contain the following functions:
function to display the rules and story.
function to start game
function to create random number for wizzard
function to check if user inputs correct number and reduce the tryes
function to ask the user to quit or continue
